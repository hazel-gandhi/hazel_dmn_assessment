This repository contains some pseudo-code for the Task 1 part of the assessment. 

- `task-1.ipynb`: Notebook where I used Python to scrape the grand jury cases from Dallas County's [Public Information Act Request](https://www.dallascounty.org/dcpia/search) portal. 

- `grand_jury_cases` folder: CSVs exported from the analysis containing month-wise grand jury dispositon data.
