# Dallas Morning News Data Reporter Assessment

Assessment doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EL3kMQ4TnMNaElMu-WWYtElD_PBviYI58h_Umss4fLk/edit?tab=t.0

This repository contains some pseudo-code for the Task 1 part of the assessment. 

- `task-1.ipynb`: Notebook where I used Python to scrape the grand jury cases from Dallas County's [Public Information Act Request](https://www.dallascounty.org/dcpia/search) portal. For the sake of this assignment, I have assumed the reporter wants the dispositions and not scheduled cases. This is one of the clarifying questions I'd ask the reporter before doing the scraping.

- `grand_jury_cases` folder: CSVs exported from the analysis containing month-wise grand jury dispositon data.
